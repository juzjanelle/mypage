          This is a Picture of Nuclear Fission
        </div>
        <p> The nuclear Fission of the heavy elements was discovered by this man called Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann. They found it on December 17, 1938 and was invented by different scientists and was produced about 100 kW. I don't know much about it. It was invented at a time I wasn't born (to be specific) and this advantage     of the nuclear fission is: Nuclear power reactors do not produce any direct carbon dioxide emissions that could contribute to the global warming effect on the planet. This process does not produce any form of air pollution while operating either. The primary adverse impact that it creates on the environment comes from the mining activities of uranium and the refining efforts needed to turn it into fuel. These tasks require a significant amount of energy. </p>

        <h3>My Essay</h3>
        <p>In a nuclear reactor, a neutron is absorbed into a nucleus (typically uranium-235). This causes the nucleus to become uranium-236, which is violently unstable.

The entire nucleus splits into two large fragments called 'daughter nuclei'. In addition to the 'daughter' products, two or three neutrons also explode out of the fission reaction and these can collide with other uranium nuclei to cause further fission reactions. This is known as a chain reaction.

The fast moving neutrons carry most of the energy from the reaction with them (99%) but before the neutrons can collide with fresh uranium nuclei, they need to be slowed down.

This is so that the energy can pass on to other components in the nuclear reactor, which is used to heat water to drive the turbines that turn the generators.</p>
        <p>There are a number of different nuclear fusion reactions happening in the Sun. The simplest is when four hydrogen nuclei become one helium nuclei.


The combined mass of four hydrogen nuclei is 6.693 × 10-27 kilograms (kg). The mass of one helium nucleus is 6.645 × 10-27 kg. This means that there is a missing amount of mass equalling 0.048 × 10-27 kg.

The missing mass is converted to energy, which radiates away. This is seen happening in the Sun.

In all nuclear reactions a small amount of the mass changes to energy. This may not seem like a lot of energy but this energy is a result of the fusion of only four hydrogen nuclei.

A 250 millilitre (ml) glass of water will contain around 1.6 × 1025 hydrogen atoms. Complete fusion of all these hydrogen nuclei would release about 17,200,000,000,000 joules (J) of energy. It is estimated that the sun releases 3.8 × 1026 joules of energy every second.

However, the issue with fusion is that it requires the fusing of nuclei, which are positive particles. As two nuclei approach each other, they will repel because they have the same charge. The fusion of the nuclei has to happen quickly so that the repulsion of the charges does not have time to stop it from happening.

A way that particles can travel that quickly is by being in a hot gas or in plasma, like in the Sun. In fact, for fusion to occur, the temperature of the hot gas or plasma needs to be at least 150,000,000 degrees Celsius (°C).</p>
<h2><<p> We would not live a good life as the nuclear fission is something to do with energy, without nuclear fission there will be no nuclear plants too. A nuclear fission is a reaction in which a heavy nucleus splits spontaneously or on impact with another particle, with the release of energy. Nuclear power releases less radiation into the environment than any other major energy source.

Nuclear power plants operate at much higher capacity factors than renewable energy sources or fossil fuels. Capacity factor is a measure of what percentage of the time a power plant actually produces energy. It’s a problem for all intermittent energy sources. The sun doesn’t always shine, nor the wind always blow, nor water always fall through the turbines of a dam.

In the United States in 2016, nuclear power plants, which generated almost 20 percent of U.S. electricity, had an average capacity factor of 92.3 percent, meaning they operated at full power on 336 out of 365 days per year. (The other 29 days they were taken off the grid for maintenance.) In contrast, U.S. hydroelectric systems delivered power 38.2 percent of the time (138 days per year), wind turbines 34.5 percent of the time (127 days per year) and solar electricity arrays only 25.1 percent of the time (92 days per year). Even plants powered with coal or natural gas only generate electricity about half the time for reasons such as fuel costs and seasonal and nocturnal variations in demand. Nuclear is a clear winner on reliability.

Third, nuclear power releases less radiation into the environment than any other major energy source. This statement will seem paradoxical to many readers, since it’s not commonly known that non-nuclear energy sources release any radiation into the environment. They do. The worst offender is coal, a mineral of the earth’s crust that contains a substantial volume of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium. Burning coal gasifies its organic materials, concentrating its mineral components into the remaining waste, called fly ash. So much coal is burned in the world and so much fly ash produced that coal is actually the major source of radioactive releases into the environment.
